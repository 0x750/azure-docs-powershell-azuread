# Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph

Windows PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed for system administration.
Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, Windows PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework, and accepts and returns .NET Framework objects.

If you are developing new PowerShell scripts with Azure AD cmdlets we advise you to use the newer [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph cmdlets](/powershell/module/azuread?view=azureadps-2.0&preserve-view=true).

For more information about, or for the syntax of, any of the cmdlets, use the `Get-Help <cmdlet name>` command, where `<cmdlet name>` is the name of the cmdlet that you want to research.
For more detailed information, you can run any of the following commands:

* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Detailed`
* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Examples`
* `Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Full`
